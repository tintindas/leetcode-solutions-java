# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

## Problem

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named _good_ if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

## Idea

Whenever presented with a counting problem in a binary tree a recursive solution is the easiest approach. Think of a way to do it for any node by getting the answers of the left and right subtree of that node for free (assume you already have these) and doing calculations for the given node.

So, our approach is to get the solutions for the left and right subtrees recursively and decide if the current node is _good_ by comparing it with the highest value we have seen in the path we have taken to get to the node. We keep updating the highest value in the path as we travel down the tree.

## Solution

### First Iteration

The first attempt at a solution is always quite ugly looking.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int solver(TreeNode node, int highestValueInPath) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        int goodNodes = 0;

        if (node.val >= highestValueInPath) {
            goodNodes += 1;
        }

        highestValueInPath = Math.max(highestValueInPath, node.val);

        int goodLeftNodes = 0;
        int goodRightNodes = 0;

        if(node.left != null) {
            goodLeftNodes = solver(node.left, highestValueInPath);
        }

        if(node.right != null) {
            goodRightNodes = solver(node.right, highestValueInPath);
        }

        goodNodes += goodLeftNodes + goodRightNodes;

        return goodNodes;

    }

    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {`
        return solver(root, root.val);
    }
}
```

### Second Iteration

The second attempt with a bit of clean up is nicer to look at.

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int solver(TreeNode node, int highestValueInPath) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        int goodNodes = 0;

        if (node.val >= highestValueInPath) {
            goodNodes += 1;
        }

        highestValueInPath = Math.max(highestValueInPath, node.val);


        if(node.left != null) {
            goodNodes += solver(node.left, highestValueInPath);
        }

        if(node.right != null) {
            goodNodes += solver(node.right, highestValueInPath);
        }

        return goodNodes;

    }

    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return solver(root, root.val);
    }
}
```
