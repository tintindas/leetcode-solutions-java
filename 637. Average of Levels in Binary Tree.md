# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10<sup>-5</sup> of the actual answer will be accepted.

## Idea

Easy questions are easy for a reason. Not much thinking required here. Do a level while traversal (BFS) on the tree. On every level sum up the elements and divide by the size of the level to get the average.

**Note** - When we have processed all the nodes of one level we have all the nodes of the next level in the queue.

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        LinkedList<Double> ans = new LinkedList<Double>();

        if (root == null) return ans;

        LinkedList<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        q.add(root);

        while(!q.isEmpty()) {
            double size = q.size();
            double sum = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode node = q.remove();
                if (node.left != null) {
                    q.add(node.left);
                }
                if (node.right != null) {
                    q.add(node.right);
                }
                sum += node.val;
            }
            ans.add(sum/size);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
