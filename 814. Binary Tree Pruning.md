# [814. Binary Tree Pruning](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

A subtree of a node node is node plus every node that is a descendant of node.

## Idea

We can only prune a node and its subtrees if none of them contain a 1. We achieve this recursively. In the function we prune every leaf node which has the value 0. We can do this as we make recursive calls and thus the child nodes are processed before the parent node. Therefore, we already have the answer to the subproblem defined by the left and right subtrees when we compute the answer to the current node. The only way, a node with value zero will have children is if in one of the subtrees we have come across a 1 and thus not pruned that subtree.

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode pruneTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return null;
        }

        root.left = pruneTree(root.left);
        root.right = pruneTree(root.right);

        if (root.val == 0 && root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return null;
        }

        return root;
    }
}
```
