# [606. Construct String from Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/)

## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

## Idea

A simple preorder traversal of the tree solves the problem. The parenthesis problem can be solved simply by handling the case where the right child does not exist. In that case we do not need the parethesis that would close around the right child. In the case of a leaf node we simply return the value of the node as a string.

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public String tree2str(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return "";
        }

        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            return Integer.toString(root.val);
        }

        if (root.right == null) {
            return root.val + "(" + tree2str(root.left) +")";
        }

        return root.val + "(" + tree2str(root.left) +")(" + tree2str(root.right) + ")";
    }
}
```
